# Who is a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is a worker whose primary job responsibilities involve preparing data for analytical 
or operational uses. The specific tasks handled by data engineers can vary from organization to 
organization but typically include building data pipelines to pull together information from 
different source systems; integrating, consolidating and cleansing data; and structuring it 
for use in individual analytics applications.

# Data engineer responsibilities

Data engineers often work as part of an analytics team alongside data scientists. 
The engineers provide data in usable formats to the data scientists who run queries
and algorithms against the information for predictive analytics, machine learning and 
data mining applications.

Data engineers also deliver aggregated data to business executives and analysts and other end 
users so they can analyze it and apply the results to improving business operations.

Data engineers deal with both structured and unstructured data. Structured data is information that 
can be organized into a formatted repository like a database. Unstructured data -- such as text, images,
audio and video files -- doesn't conform to conventional data models. 

# Data Engineering Tools and Skills

#### Data engineers use many different tools to work with data. They use a specialized skill set to create
 end-to-end data pipelines that move data from source systems totarget destinations.
 
- Data engineers are skilled in programming languages such as C#, Java, Python, R, Ruby, Scala and SQL. 
  Python, R and SQL are the three most important languages data engineers use.

- Engineers need a good understanding of ETL tools and REST-oriented APIs for creating and managing data 
 integration jobs. These skills also help in providing data analysts and business users with simplified access 
 to prepared data sets.

- Data engineers must understand data warehouses and data lakes and how they work. For instance, 
 Hadoop data lakes that offload the processing and storage work of established enterprise data warehouses 
 support the big data analytics efforts data engineers work on.

- Data engineers must also understand NoSQL databases and Apache Spark systems, which are becoming common components
 of data workflows. Data engineers should have a knowledge of relational database systems as well, such as MySQL and
 PostgreSQL. Another focus is Lambda architecture, which supports unified data pipelines for batch and real-time processing.

- Business intelligence (BI) platforms and the ability to configure them are another important focus for data engineers. 
  With BI platforms, they can establish connections among data warehouses, data lakes and other data sources. Engineers 
  must know how to work with the interactive dashboards BI platforms use.
