# Who is a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is a worker whose primary job responsibilities involve preparing data for analytical 
or operational uses. The specific tasks handled by data engineers can vary from organization to 
organization but typically include building data pipelines to pull together information from 
different source systems; integrating, consolidating and cleansing data; and structuring it 
for use in individual analytics applications.

# Data engineer responsibilities

Data engineers often work as part of an analytics team alongside data scientists. 
The engineers provide data in usable formats to the data scientists who run queries
and algorithms against the information for predictive analytics, machine learning and 
data mining applications.

Data engineers also deliver aggregated data to business executives and analysts and other end 
users so they can analyze it and apply the results to improving business operations.

Data engineers deal with both structured and unstructured data. Structured data is information that 
can be organized into a formatted repository like a database. Unstructured data -- such as text, images,
audio and video files -- doesn't conform to conventional data models.
